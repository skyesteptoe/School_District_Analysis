## Status
I have been unsuccessful in using loc to calculate math and reading percentages using existing data for 10th-12th grade Thomas High School students. I am submitting an incomplete Challenge with only Deliverable 1 complete and Deliverable 2 only partally complete. 

I will reach out to a tutor and attempt to resolve for resubmission in the near future.
